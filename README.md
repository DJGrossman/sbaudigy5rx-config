# sbaudigy5rx-config

An [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) script that turns off "CMSS 3D" and turns on "Stereo Direct / Bit Accurate Playback" through the [Control Panel](https://support.creative.com/downloads/download.aspx?nDownloadId=100373) for the [Sound Blaster Audigy 5/Rx](https://us.creative.com/p/sound-blaster/sound-blaster-audigy-rx?ctlcmp=CO-US22312) since these settings are forgotten with each reboot and Creative refuses to fix it.
